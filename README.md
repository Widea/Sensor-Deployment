Sensor-Deployment
=================

Sensor Deployment,comparing random deployment with regular square deployment using NS2.


Snow detection and measurement is one of the most important areas in
weather observation systems. The main objectives that are accounted
for are to obtain quality assurance and control, to identify the factors
which affect the sensor and its performance and to come up with an
algorithm which would give best measurements from an automated
sensor snow depth. The main aim of our project is to find optimal
sensor deployment strategies. The sensors if not deployed in the right
manner may lead to various problems, one such problem is the sensor
connecting problem where the sensors being deployed may not cover
the whole area. Hence, deploying the sensors in the right manner is
very important. The two strategies which can be used for this are
regular deployment and random deployment. In random deployment,
N sensors are randomly deployed by distributing them in a scattered
manner in an area. In the regular deployment strategy, mainly used for
civilian applications, the sensors which are being deployed will be
accessible since they are in a specific pattern. Our proposal is an
amalgamation of these two strategies in an attempt to get the best
throughput as compared to the other two. It is a pseudo-random
approach, where the sensors will be deployed randomly but in a
manner in which it will not interfere with each other and will end up
having more coverage area.
